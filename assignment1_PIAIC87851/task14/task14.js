var a = 2,

var result = --a - --b + ++b + b--;
/*This line performs a series of operations using the variables a and b, and assigns the result to a new variable called result.
 Here is what each part of the expression does:

1. --a: The prefix decrement operator -- decrements the value of a by 1 before the expression is evaluated.
 So a becomes 1, and the expression returns 1.

2. --a - --b: The prefix decrement operator -- decrements the value of a by 1, and the value of b by 1 before the expression is evaluated.
 So a remains 1, and b becomes 0. The expression evaluates to 1 - 0 = 1.

3. --a - --b + ++b: The prefix decrement operator -- decrements the value of a by 1, and the value of b by 1 before the expression is evaluated.
 So a remains 1, and b becomes 0 again. However, the prefix increment operator ++ increments the value of b by 1 before the expression is evaluated.
 So b becomes 1. The expression evaluates to 1 - 0 + 1 = 2.

4. --a - --b + ++b + b--: The prefix decrement operator -- decrements the value of a by 1, and the value of b by 1 before the expression is evaluated.
 So a remains 1, and b becomes 0 again. The prefix increment operator ++ increments the value of b by 1 before the expression is evaluated.
 So b becomes 1. The postfix decrement operator -- decrements the value of b by 1 after the expression is evaluated.
 So b becomes 0 again. The expression evaluates to 1 - 0 + 1 + 1 = 3.*/
